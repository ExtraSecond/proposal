\subsection{Operating Systems with Rust}

Rust is a programming language designed to do system programming and has safety mechanisms designed in the core language.

The browser has become de facto operating systems nowadays.
Servo\cite{Servo} is a Rust version of browser engine designed by Mozilla.
Yet, the browser engine is not a good fit for IoT as the code base tend to be huge.

There have also been attempts on writing a new OS from scratch using Rust.
Redox\cite{Redox} is a microkernel based OS, it is highly finished and totally useable with POSIX API implemented in Rust and a GUI for desktop users.
Some individuals are also writing personal blogs\cite{OsPhil} to write an OS from scratch step by step, yet it is still not finished and only runs in QEMU. 

Few attempts have been made on writing Rust based embeded OS, but non of them are target any specific security issues like we do.
Tock\cite{levy2015ownership, levy2017tock, levy2017multiprogramming} is an embedded operating system designed for running multiple concurrent, mutually distrustful applications on Cortex-M and RISC-V based embedded platforms.
Sergio finished an IoT OS framework in Rust\cite{cs140e} and leave the rest to the student as the course project in CS140e in Stanford.
