\section{Implementation}

We would take down the parts and implement this system step by step.

As the first step we would implement IoTOS on \rpi. 
The mile stone for the first stage is to ask IoTOS to host two processes and for them to be able to communicate through network APIs.
Here, to make things easier we would not implement encryption nor authantication yet.

The second part would be to implement the drivers for LED light, slave process and master process.
By the end of this part we would be able to connect two \rpis. 
They should be able to identify who's slave and who's master according to configuration and master device is able to open a LED  connected to slave device.

The thrid part would be to secure all the things we have implemented.
One would be to force devices communite through HTTPS, another would be to ask every entity in this network, including user himself, to proof them not malicious through authtication methods.
