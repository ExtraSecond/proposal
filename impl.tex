\section{Time line \& milestones}

We would take down the parts and implement this system step by step.

\begin{itemize}
    \item By 2/19 we would have a free-standing rust application running upon L4\cite{L4}. L4 is a microkernel that takes care of underline hardwares.

    \item By 2/26 we should have basic \ritos on \rpi running. 
    The milestone would be to ask \ritos to host two processes, and for them to be able to communicate through network APIs.
    Here, to make things easier, we would not implement encryption nor authentication yet.

    \item By 3/4 we would have GPIO and network drivers ready.
    By the end of this part, we would be able to connect two \rpis. 
    They should be able to identify who's the slave and who's the master according to configuration and master device can open a LED  connected to the slave device.
    
    \item By 3/11 part would be to secure all the things we have implemented and we would have code freeze.
    One would be to force devices to communicate through HTTPS; another would be to ask every entity in this network, including the user himself, to prove them not malicious through authentication methods.
    
    \item Final report should be done by 3/19.

\end{itemize}
