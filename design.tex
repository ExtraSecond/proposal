\section{Design}

As shown in \autoref{fig::design::os-overview}, our system take a micro-kernel architecture.
However, we intend to put the network stack inside the kernel.
Therefore, instead of providing \texttt{send()} and \texttt{recv()} system calls, we would make all POSIX APIs with regard to networks our system calls, including \texttt{socket()}, \texttt{recv()}, \texttt{send()}, etc.

In this IoTOS, all processes are represented by an IP address with a port number. Inter-Process Communication(IPC) is no different than issuing a command over the internet.

As shown in \autoref{fig::design::system-overview}, different devices are connected to a master device which controls everything.
Instead of talking to different devices the user can only talk to the master device.
This design guarantees that only when a malicious hacker has all passphrases of a user, he can't do any harm until he controls the master device.
Since any slave device only talks to the master device, they can't temper with each other too.

For a user to talk to the master device, an extra authentication needs to be done to guarantee that the "user" is not a hacker.
This process can be done using 2FA, i.e. One-time password(OTP), email confirmation, etc.
